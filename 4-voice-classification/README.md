Using a machine learning algorithm to forecast voice classifications
                                                                    
the most well-known contest on Kaggle. My goal in creating this repository is to essentially teach to every newbie how to use Kaggle for the first time. Therefore, people who are just starting their machine learning journey should use this repository. 
I try to write down every item in my notebook in a very simplistic manner so that even a complete novice may understand it.

Dependencies:

    Python3
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Label Encoder
    Standard Scaler
    Train Test Split
    SVC
    Matrics
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Classification Algorithms
    
This Notebook will show basic examples of:

    Data Handling
    Importing Data with Pandas
    Cleaning Data
    Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
